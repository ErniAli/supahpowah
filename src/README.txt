The main class is in backend.Driver

If you run the project in netbeans, you need to set the configuration like so: 
Right click on project > Set configurations > Customize
On the Project Properties window that pops up, enter: 
- Main class: backend.Driver
- Arguments: input.lisp  --> (this is only if the input file is named input.lisp), 
            so change this argument appropriately. It takes in the name of the 
            input file).
